Using Bill Benter's (1994) methods on german horse racing

The most influential paper on how to predict the outcome of a horse race and how to use modern computing for 
this task has been written in 1994 by Bill Benter: 
[Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1994-benter.pdf) 

Here I will try and show a little bit of Benter's process and some methods with the results of german horse races. The whole process is divided into the following steps:
* Data Collection
* Data Cleaning
* Data Analysis
* The Model
* Results

# german-horse-racing

## Description:
This repository contains scripts and data related to German horse racing. It aims to provide tools to acquire and clean german flat racing results. Finally some of Bill Benter's methods - presented in his seminal 1994 paper [Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1994-benter.pdf) - will be employed to search for inefficiencies in the german betting market.

## Getting Started:
Before using this directory, you'll need to have Python and R installed on your system. Additionally, specific libraries might be required depending on the scripts you intend to use.
Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/chris-alex-p/german-horse-racing.git
```

## Data:
The `data` directory contains raw and processed data related to German horse racing.


The most influential paper on how to predict the outcome of a horse race and how to use modern computing for 
this task has been written in 1994 by Bill Benter: 
[Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1994-benter.pdf) 

Here I will try and show a little bit of Benter's process and some methods with the results of german horse races. The whole process is divided into the following steps:
* Data Collection
* Data Cleaning
* Data Analysis
* The Model
* Results
